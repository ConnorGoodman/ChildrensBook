# ChildrensBook

My teams project during NWHacks 2020 in Vancouver Canada!

We created a childrens book application designed to help children learn how to read.

Pages are read aloud to the user. The user can then speak the words on the page back to the application.

The application will provide feedback on the pronunciation.
