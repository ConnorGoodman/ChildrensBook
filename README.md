# ChildrensBook

## Overview
My team's project during NWHacks 2020 in Vancouver Canada!

We had 48 hours to create a project that would improve a critical field for our society, and our group chose education.

We created a childrens book application designed to help children learn how to read.

Pages are read aloud to the user. The user can then speak the words on the page back to the application.

The application will provide feedback on the pronunciation.

## Tech Stack
This project utilizes Azure Cognitive Services to both read stories aloud, and to listen to how words are pronounced by the users.
The code was written in Java.
